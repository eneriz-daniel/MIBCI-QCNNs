    "# MIBCI-QCNNs: Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks automates the simulation and synthesis of the EEGNet-based model HLS design. This design is based on the files with the format `MIBCI-QCNN-X-template.txt` saved in the root directory of the repo. These are the parametriced templates that can be readed from Python and the writed into a `.cpp` (or `.h` it its the header file), forming the followinf files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MIBCI-QCNN.cpp`\n",
    "- `MIBCI-QCNN.h`\n",
    "- `MIBCI-QCNN-tb.cpp`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one, `MIBCI-QCNN.cpp`  is the file with the algorithmic description of the hardware to systhentize with HLS and then to implement in the FPGA. After the declaration of the activation functions, LeakyReLU and Softmax, there is the top function, MIBCI_QCNN in which the C++ impementation of the model is contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header file, `MIBCI-QCNN.h`, contains the parameters of the dataset (time window, dowsampling, number of classes, number of channels, sampling frecuency...), the architecure paramenters (kernels' sizes, number of filters, LReLU alphas...) and the fixed-point datatype description, which in this case is <16,8>, since it showed the best balance in the number of bits and the accuracy drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the test bench `MIBCI-QCNN-tb.cpp`. It is created to load both the model parameters and the input samples from `.npy` files and validate the model implemented in C++ for the entire dataset. As outputs, it writes a `y_hls_16_8.txt` for each fold, containig the model's output of the validation set of that fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare the model to be implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the HLS simualtion, the folder of each model's fold must have an `npyparams` folder containing its pararmeters and another folder called `valdiationDS` with the validation set of the fold, with the inputs (`X.npy`) explited per index, `X_i-npy`. All of this is automated in the [`createnpys.py` `utils` file](utils/createnpys.py)."
